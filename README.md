# human_to_cartoon

This is a small project that transforming human pictures into cartoon images, and also capable of transforming cartoon images into human images. The methods applied is CycleGAN. 

CycleGAN is primarily used to transform domain of an image into another domain. In this project, we trained two generators and two discriminators to apply cyclegan. Because the training time takes too long, our model does not perform very well on human-cartoon transformation. However, given more time, we will train more and make generator better for transformation.
